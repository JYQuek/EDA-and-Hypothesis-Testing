# Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing using Python

In this project, I will be performing data cleaning and visualization using Python on 2 datasets, to showcase various techniques and visualization tools:
  - SAT Scores
  - Drug Usage

Thereafter, I will also formulate a hypothesis and perform hypothesis testing on the "Drug Usage" dataset. 

## Data Visualization 
For visualization of the datasets, the Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were used for various plots e.g. histogram, box plot, heatmap, pairplot. Through effective visualization, distinct trends were observed, which I then used to formulate a hypothesis. 

## Hypothesis Testing 
I conducted a chi-square test on my hypothesis. In this project, I detailed how I conducted the chi-square test and how I intepreted the results to form a conclusion.
